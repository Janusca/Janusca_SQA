Creating a hello world repository

Life is short and everyone has something that they are passionate about. Be able to say that you didn't let fear hold you back. The cost of not following your heart is spending the rest of your life wishing you had.Even if you fail, it doesn't mean you will continue to fail. Be able to say you believed in yourself and kept trying. Everything that is successful will begin with you believing in yourself.Never apologize for high standards; people who really want to be in your life will rise up to meet them. The quality of who you are is reflected in the standards you set for yourself; position yourself to live up to the rise of your own expectations. Talk to people the way you want to be spoken to; respect people as you wish to be respected. Your status, religion, race, political views, or culture don't matter--being a good person really is as simple as following the golden rule and treating others as you would like them to treat you.
